  - or via <https://www.continuum.io/downloads> (Python 3.5, 64-bit)
2. copy the `nltk_data` folder into your user's home folder (e.g.
   `C:\\Users\<your username>` on Windows)
3. (pass the flash drive on to the next person)
4. **run the Anaconda installer**
5. (we'll do this together) install the `regex` package

If need be, don't be shy and ask for help!
