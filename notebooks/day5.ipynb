    "As you can see, engineers like to separate language perception and production into neat, self-contained tasks, because it's more manageable from an engineering point of view if you're dealing with one well-defined task. This is obviously not how it works in humans -- the various stages are interconnected, top-down and bottom-up neural processes interact. \n",
    "\n",
    "Early work in generative grammar was in favor of such a modular concept, but more contemporary trends such as construction grammar advocate a more holistic approach towards representing linguistic knowledge, where constraints from these various linguistic levels coexist.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice though, it's very hard even for engineers to completely separate these tasks -- quite simply because it turns out that you just need information from multiple levels in order to do a state-of-the-art job at any of them. For instance, if you're doing speech recognition, you'd better have an idea of the lexicon, morphology and syntax of the language you're trying to recognize in order to constrain the guesses you're making about the acoustic signal you're trying to analyze.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also very exciting attempts to do computer modeling of speech perception and production that somehow mimicks the complexity, interconnectedness and extensive feedback mechanisms between the various layers that humans seem to be relying on. For an overview, check out the open-access book [The Talking Heads experiment: Origins of words and meanings](langsci-press.org//catalog/book/49) by Luc Steels."

    "**Lemmatizers** serve the same purpose as stemmers, but instead of using rules, they're generally backed by a database of words and their forms within a particular language, and possibly a system for disambiguating between rival interpretations based on context (either rule-based or stochastic, i.e. statistically trained). Whereas stemmers often yield truncated strings that are not really words in themselves (which may be useful nonetheless, if each inflection of a word yields the same truncated form and therefore performs the correct grouping), lemmatizers yield dictionary headwords (lemmas)."

    "For highly inflected languages like Czech, making a stemmer based on a set of rules with exceptions would be so much work that you might as well go directly with full blown lemmatization and morphological tagging, considering the results will be much more useful. Unfortunately, there's no module in NLTK to help you with that -- but other third-party open-source tools do exist! One of them is the MorphoDiTa tagger by [ÚFAL MFF UK](http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/), which you can [try out on-line](http://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/services/morphodita/demo.php), [download](http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/morphodita/install), or use its [web API](http://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/services/morphodita/api-reference.php). We'll go with the third option, because it's both very easy to use (no installation required) and integrates very well with Python (or indeed any programming environment).\n",
    "\n",
    "A web API (or Application Programming Interface) is a service that allows you to post requests to a server on the web, have it process your request and receive some structured data back. It's very similar to just browsing the web using your browser, but instead of getting back HTML-formatted pages, which contain a lot of information focused on the visual presentation of the data you've requested, you get back only \"the meat\", i.e. the actual data, in an easily machine parsable format (either JSON or XML). We'll look at XML some other time, but JSON basically maps very closely to a data structure you could build by nesting Python dictionaries and lists inside each other, so it should feel very natural.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's dive in and create some functions to lemmatize Czech text using the MorphoDiTa web API. All we need to know about the API is contained in [MorphoDiTa's documentation](http://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/services/morphodita/api-reference.php). By the way, you could also simply use the API in your browser -- just visit [http://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/services/morphodita/api/tag?data=Děti pojedou k babičce. Už se těší.&output=json](http://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/services/morphodita/api/tag?data=Děti pojedou k babičce. Už se těší.&output=json&convert_tagset=strip_lemma_id) to see what it returns. Our task will be to make a function which visits this kind of URL in Python instead of in your browser, receives back the same output and interprets it."
